Tester compare : Expected vs Actual

Expected : comes from requirements or documentation
Actual : from the browser

to do any action on any webelement:
1. need to locate
2. do the action

findElement method:
        accepts as parameter -> string--locators
        return --> single WebElement
findElements method
        accepts locator
        return --> List<WebElement>

8 Locators:
id --> Unique however can be dynamic
name --> check for duplicate
class name --> good for findElements method to locate multiple elelemnts
tagName -->  good for findElements method to locate multiple elelemnts
LinkText and Partial LinkText --> <a ....anchor tag  href='somelinktext'

If they locate more than one element, it will do the action to first element.

xpath and css: custom locators that you can manipulate

P.I.Q.: Most common exception I am getting?
No such element exception
What are the reasons:
1. Wrong locators
2. Delay in the page, your element is not loaded yet to the DOM (synchronization issue)
3. Developers changed something


TestNG
annotations: instead main method now we will have @Test annotation


CSS Locators:
tagName[attribute='value']   main css syntax
[attribute='value']  short syntax

just for ID and Class, if the attribute is ID or Class
#id
.class

Stale element exception : second most common exception
we need to refresh the Selenium code for the same WebElement
